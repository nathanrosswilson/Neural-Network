# Neural-Network
I created this neural network for a course at the University of Michigan structured as below.

It trains on data from [MNIST handwriting database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and is built to identify handwritten digits from images.

The program takes in the images of thousands of handwritten numbers and splits it into the training and testing data. It then explores four different learning rates that output their learning statistics to the CSV files.

The final learning rate for testing is 0.1 and has the resulting accuracy of 96% thus identifying the correct number 98% of the time.
