# Neural-Network
I created this neural network for a course at the University of Michigan structured as below.

It trains on data from [MNIST handwriting database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The program takes in the MNIST data and splits it into the training and testing data. It then explores four different learning rates that output their learning statistics to the CSV files.

The final learning rate for testing is 0.1 and has the resulting accuracy of 96%.
